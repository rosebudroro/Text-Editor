# Text-Editor

## Description

For this assignment, I am to build a text editor that runs in the browser. It will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options are not supported by the browser. It will also be able to function offline.
